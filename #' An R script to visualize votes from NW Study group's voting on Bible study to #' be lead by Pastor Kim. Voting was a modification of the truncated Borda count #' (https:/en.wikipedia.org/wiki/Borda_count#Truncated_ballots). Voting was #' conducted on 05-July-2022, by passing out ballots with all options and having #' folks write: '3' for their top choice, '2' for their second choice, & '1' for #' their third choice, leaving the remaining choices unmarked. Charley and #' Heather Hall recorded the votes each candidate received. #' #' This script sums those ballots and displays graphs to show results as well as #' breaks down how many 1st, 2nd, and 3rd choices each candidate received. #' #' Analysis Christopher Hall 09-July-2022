Voting results summer 2022 copc nw study


Copied from intro to R Script:

#' An R script to visualize votes from NW Study group's voting on Bible study to
#' be lead by Pastor Kim. Voting was a modification of the truncated Borda count
#' (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count#Truncated_ballots). Voting was
#' conducted on 05-July-2022, by passing out ballots with all options and having
#' folks write: '3' for their top choice, '2' for their second choice, & '1' for
#' their third choice, leaving the remaining choices unmarked. Charley and
#' Heather Hall recorded the votes each candidate received.
#'
#' This script sums those ballots and displays graphs to show results as well as
#' breaks down how many 1st, 2nd, and 3rd choices each candidate received.
